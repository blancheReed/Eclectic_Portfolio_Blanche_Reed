## Project Requirements

### Content

- [x] At least one profile picture
      This profile picture is of me modeling at Bullocky Rest park. I chose this image to represent me on the webpage because I think the image represents one of my interests outside of work which is Indigenous fashion. I have placed the profile picture above the 'About Me' information to create a good flow.

- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
      I aim to uplift my audience with practical advice and inspire the artist within us all! I try to evolve both my technical skills and creative endeavours in these featured projects to lead the way for my people in all communities. I identify as a First Nations woman with pronouns She/Her. I am a descendant of the Kalkadoon, Pitta Pitta, Mitakoodi, Gooreng Gooreng, Yidinji people. I am also neurodiverse/ a disability community member. I enjoy the following hobbies:
      Dancing/ Gym; Writing the manuscript for my novel; Learning Indigenous languages; Boxing; Writing songs and poems; Creating content for my YouTube channel; Posing in photos for my amateur modelling portfolio; Creating digital art & Sewing.

- [x] Functional Contact Form

- [x] "Projects" section
      Homepage: This webpage is to introduce myself and link the user to other webpages. I have also created a contact form and social media links.

My Career: This webpage is dedicated to my tech career journey. I have a written story and a vlog that I recorded.

My Visuals: This is a page that hosts five of my amateur modeling photos and some of my digital artworks.

My Voice: This webpage is a compilation of my poems and a video of a poem I read to the sound of the didgeridoo.

### Technical

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
      I have created five webpages for my portfolio. I enjoyed coding these pages and each page serves the important purpose of showcasing an element of my personality. I think the hardest page to create was the Homepage. Other challenges I faced were with aligning images. The best part of this webpage portfolio project is that is will grow as I learn more.

- [x] Version controlled with Git
      I have been consistently pushing my code to my git repository named blancheReed. Link: https://github.com/blancheReed. I found a challenge in the initial push request as I was attempting to push videos from my local folder. I learnt how to remove items that have been a part of a previous push request. I also now embed my video content from YouTube as a best practice.

- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
      I have deployed my webpages onto GitHub pages. The link is provided at the top of this md file.

- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
      I have used the CSS media attribute to make my webpages responsive. I preferred the mobile design process the most.

- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

I used appropriate HTML tags: Instead of using generic <div> elements for everything, select the specific HTML tags that accurately describe the content they contain. For example:

Use <header> for the header section of your page.
Use <nav> for the navigation menu.
Use <article> for self-contained articles or blog posts.
Use <section> to group related content.
Use <footer> for the footer section of your page.

### Bonus (optional)

- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
      On the Homepage I used hover on the content panels. The filter was set to contrast at 150%.

- [x] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extratricky!)
      I used the following JavaScript code to action behaviour in my navigation bar:

const hamburgerButton = document.querySelector(".hamburger-button");
const mobileNav = document.querySelector(".mobile-nav");

hamburgerButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
mobileNav.classList.toggle("display-none");
});

### Screenshots> Please include the following:

> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take ascreenshot that shows that.>> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and includingthem in your readme document with the following Markdown code:

#### {{ image_title }}![ {{ Description of image }} ]( {{ ./relative_path_to_file }} )

- [ ] Hover of Content Panel
