## Project Requirements

### Content

- [x] At least one profile picture
      This profile picture is of me modeling at Bullocky Rest park. I chose this image to represent me on the webpage because I think the image represents one of my interests outside of work which is Indigenous fashion. I have placed the profile picture above the 'About Me' information to create a good flow.

### Technical

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
      I have created five webpages for my portfolio. I enjoyed coding these pages and each page serves the important purpose of showcasing an element of my personality. I think the hardest page to create was the Homepage. Other challenges I faced were with aligning images. The best part of this webpage portfolio project is that is will grow as I learn more.

- [x] Version controlled with Git
      I have been consistently pushing my code to my git repository named blancheReed. Link: https://github.com/blancheReed. I found a challenge in the initial push request as I was attempting to push videos from my local folder. I learnt how to remove items that have been a part of a previous push request. I also now embed my video content from YouTube as a best practice.

- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
      I have deployed my webpages onto GitHub pages. The link is provided at the top of this md file.

- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
      I have used the CSS media attribute to make my webpages responsive. I preferred the mobile design process the most.

- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

I used appropriate HTML tags: Instead of using generic div elements for everything, select the specific HTML tags that accurately describe the content they contain. For example:

Use header for the header section of your page.
Use nav for the navigation menu.
Use article for self-contained articles or blog posts.
Use section to group related content.
Use footer for the footer section of your page.

### Bonus (optional)

- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
      On the Homepage I used hover on the content panels. The filter was set to contrast at 150%.

- [x] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extratricky!)
      I used the following JavaScript code to action behaviour in my navigation bar:

const hamburgerButton = document.querySelector(".hamburger-button");
const mobileNav = document.querySelector(".mobile-nav");

hamburgerButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
mobileNav.classList.toggle("display-none");
});

- [x] Hover of Content Panel
