            <h2>Blanche's Modeling</h2>
            <p>
                I love opportunities to represent my community and experience personal growth.
                I celebrate my identity as a woman of colour and align myself with brands that do the same.
                The creative industries are a celebration of stories, and I want to be here for every one of them.
            </p>
