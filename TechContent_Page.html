        <p class="CareerSynopsis">
          My career progression hasn’t been a clear path into the Tech industry.
          I first started my journey in 2009 at 20 years old as a Management
          Team Member of a Not-for-profit organisation. Before that I worked in
          hospitality. The NFP company I worked for was heavily involved in
          developing sports programs and delivering coaching support to all
          members of the community. Other community engagements that were inspired
          by my Indigenous cultural background were also held such as ‘Woolkoom
          Sea Day’. This was a day when our cultural elder (my Uncle Merv) and
          the dance troop performed and a kappa-murri (underground oven) was
          prepared. I worked for the community association for 12 years. By 2021
          I was in my last year of my Master of Business Administration (MBA)
          program. I found an opportunity online that was for Indigenous people
          who would like to learn data analytics. The ‘Data Analytics and Cloud
          Training’ bootcamp was a 6-month program held online by Goanna
          Education. I enjoyed learning skills in areas such as Azure, SQL,
          Excel, Python and Power Bi. My main goal after much consideration was
          to transition into a tech career. I now had a new passion and drive
          and with the assistance of Goanna Education after I completed the
          program I was offered a position at Accenture. Accenture is a global
          consultancy company. I spent a year with Accenture while learning the
          ins and outs of my Application Development Analyst role. While working
          on the project that I was assigned to I found an area of IT that I
          hadn’t encountered before which was ‘Cybersecurity’. I became
          interested in the processes and discussions that would come up with
          the cybersecurity personnel and found the concepts compelling. I
          watched many videos and read articles about different cybersecurity
          matters. I then decided to enrol in the Cybersecurity Bootcamp with
          the University of Sydney. I learnt many aspects of cybersecurity in
          the program and had exposure the following tools: Burp Suite, Nmap,
          Zenmap, Metasploit, Snort, Shellshock, John The Ripper, Wireshark,
          Sguil, Shodan, Hashcat, Nessus, Linux (Terminal, Bash Scripting),
          Windows (Powershell), Aircrack-NG, Steganography, OSI Model, Azure
          (VM's, Load Balancer, Resource Groups, Security Rules), Containers
          (dockers), Ansible Playbooks, OWASP, OSINT Framework (Domain Dossier).
          I thoroughly enjoyed the content in the program and had the
          opportunity to connect with other people who were interested in the
          area. The Cybersecurity Bootcamp allowed me to have a foot in the door
          with an opportunity with a major Australian Bank. I commenced work
          with the bank from October 2022. My role as an Indigenous Academy
          Technology Cadet has afforded me the option to work in the cyber
          squad. I have managed to work with two different teams in my rotation
          within cyber. I have been trained in cloud technology, risk and
          controls. I decided to apply for a position as a participant in the
          She Codes Australia Plus program to learn to code this year. The
          relationship between knowing how to code and being a skilled
          cybersecurity professional very strong. Top cybersecurity
          professionals know how to interpret code and scope out any possible
          vulnerability that may exist. Also, scripting is a great tool for
          automating tasks. This is a testimonial I wrote about my recent
          experience with She Codes Australia “I'm currently working on my
          website portfolio project for the HTML/CSS module in the She Codes
          Australia Plus Program. I have been grateful for the experience the
          past 3 weeks. This portfolio will only grow more as I develop my
          coding ability and engage in more projects. I have many aspirations/
          passion projects that will greatly benefit from my ability to code
          well so that's why this opportunity has been one in a lifetime for me.
          Thank you to all the mentors and lead instructor - Andrew Bloyce. A
          huge thanks to Kate Kirwin for accepting me into the cohort and giving
          me a chance to build myself up. I'm looking forward to learning more
          throughout the 6-month program. I'm now certain that this high-quality
          practical learning environment has ignited me to aspire to greater
          heights because of the clear explanations of the content. My peers in
          the cohort who are a great source of inspiration and support are the
          cherry on top! I look forward to seeing the deliverables that are
          created from the cohort.”
